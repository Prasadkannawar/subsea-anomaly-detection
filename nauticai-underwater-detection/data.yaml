# YOLOv8 Dataset Configuration for Underwater Anomaly Detection
# This file defines the dataset structure for training YOLOv8 models

# Path to dataset root (relative to this file or absolute path)
path: ./dataset  # dataset root directory

# Path to train and validation image directories (relative to 'path')
train: images/train  # training images
val: images/val      # validation images

# Number of classes
nc: 4  # number of classes

# Class names for underwater hull inspection
names:
  0: corrosion        # rust or corrosion on hull/infrastructure
  1: marine_growth    # biofouling (barnacles, algae, marine organisms)
  2: debris           # floating debris or attached foreign objects
  3: healthy_surface  # clean, undamaged surface (for contrast learning)

# Optional: Test set
# test: images/test  # test images (optional)

# Notes:
# - Place your training images in dataset/images/train/
# - Place your validation images in dataset/images/val/
# - Place corresponding label files (.txt) in dataset/labels/train/ and dataset/labels/val/
# - Label files should have the same name as image files but with .txt extension
# - Each line in label file: <class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height> (normalized 0-1)
